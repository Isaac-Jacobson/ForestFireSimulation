March 1st - Wrote the skeleton for the Tree, Forest, and Simulator classes. 
			Then showed that I can generate a forest with trees as well as set a single tree on fire.

March 1st-4th - Finished the nuts and bolts from the last day of work and wrote a draft of the fire
				propagating from tree to tree.

March 5th - De-bugged the fire propagation to get it working as desired and refactored the propagation
			method to have all the repeated checks in a separate helper method.
			
March 5th pt2 - Created the getAveragePercentBurned method inside the simulator class to be able to
				run a large number of trials through the NonGUI class to get usable data.
				
March 6th - Finished the odds and ends of the project and generated data to be used in order to create a graph.
